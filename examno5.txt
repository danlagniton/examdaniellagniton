5. Create a loop (random number of iterations from 5-10) and 
inside that, we need to generate a random name for its value which 
we will save in Random (table) together with another loop 
(random number of iterations from 5-10) that will generate a random 5-character 
( alphanumeric ) string for the breakdown (table)

answer
set.seed(2)
times=5
m=matrix(nrow=times, ncol=10)
for (i in 1:times){
m[i,]=sample(1:10, 10, replace=F)
}
m
